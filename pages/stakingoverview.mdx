# Overview

Liquid staking is a way to allow users to stake their token and earn rewards while still having access to their assets. Traditional staking locks up users' assets, making them inaccessible. Liquid staking allows users to keep using their assets by staking them to a protocol using smart contracts and converting their staked assets into liquid tokens.

Liquid staking has the following benefits:
- Users can earn staking rewards while still having access to their assets.
- Users can participate in DeFi protocols using liquid tokens.
- Users can reduce their staking risk.

## Security

## Function

The StaFi rToken app offers three key functionalities, enhancing the user experience:
- **Stake and Unstake**: Users can easily stake and unstake their assets using the app. This allows them to participate in the staking process and earn rewards, while retaining the flexibility to withdraw their funds when needed.
- **Pool**: The app provides an opportunity to utilize rToken for participating in StaFi and DeFi liquidity mining. By leveraging rToken, users can not only earn staking rewards but also benefit from additional FIS token rewards. This dual-earning potential enhances the overall profitability of their participation.
- **Bridge**: The app enables the bridging of rTokens to various chains. For instance, users can bridge rETH to layer2 solutions, which offer lower gas fees. This functionality allows users to participate in on-chain activities with reduced costs, thus enhancing accessibility and optimizing their engagement.
