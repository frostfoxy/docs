## **What is StaFi?**

StaFi, the first multi-chain liquid staking protocol, is designed to unlock the liquidity of staked assets. It addresses the conflict between mainnet security and token liquidity inherent in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. With StaFi, users can stake their tokens without having to lock up their assets or maintain infrastructure, while simultaneously participating in on-chain activities.

- **Staking Pool**: This is a protocol that manages user deposits, staking rewards, and withdrawals.
- **rToken**: Token holders stake through staking contracts built into the StaFi protocol and receive alternative tokens (rToken, such as rETH, rMATIC, rATOM, rBNB, rSOL, etc.). These rTokens are tradable and simultaneously earn staking rewards from the original chain.
- **Governance**: The StaFi protocol operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that oversees the liquid staking protocol. The DAO is governed by both the community and the core team, who make decisions on key parameters like setting fees and selecting node operators. The DAO also accumulates service fees, which are then used to fund research, development, liquidity mining incentives, and protocol upgrades.
- **Operator**: Staking entities maintain a secure and stable infrastructure for running validator clients. This infrastructure includes high-availability servers, redundant networks, and robust security measures. By managing this infrastructure, staking entities contribute to the safety and reliability of validator nodes.

## **Liquid Staking**

Traditional staking in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol-based projects requires tokens to be locked up for an extended period in exchange for a fixed, predetermined staking reward. While this approach guarantees a return on investment, it also restricts the potential for higher returns from the DeFi ecosystem. For instance, if all your crypto holdings are staked, you cannot invest or trade in more profitable crypto pairs on exchanges.

Liquid staking is an innovative technology that allows you to earn staking rewards on your tokens without having to lock them up. With liquid staking, you can still use your tokens in DeFi protocols, such as lending and borrowing, while continuing to earn staking rewards. This approach offers the best of both worlds: a guaranteed return on your investment and the flexibility to utilize your tokens in other ways.

## **Multi-Chain**

StaFi was initially built on the Polkadot ecosystem using Substrate to construct the StaFi Chain, which facilitates staking through an appchain. Later, StaFi Hub was developed to support staking in the COSMOS ecosystem. With the evolution of the EVM ecosystem, StaFi has launched a solution for EVM Compatible Chains. Currently, the StaFi Protocol supports multi-chain ecosystems such as Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, COSMOS, Solana, Polkadot, Kusama, and more.

## **Security**

Security is our utmost priority at StaFi. We are committed to engaging more reputable security auditors to minimize potential risks. Here are some of the measures we've implemented:

- **Regular Security Audits**: StaFi collaborates with reputable security auditors to conduct regular security audits.
- **Security Incident Response Plan**: StaFi has a robust security incident response plan to swiftly and effectively respond to any security incidents.
- **Governance**: Governance decisions are made collectively by the community and the core team, ensuring a democratic and transparent process.

## FAQ

<FAQBox title="How does StaFi work">
  StaFi is a multi-chain protocol that liquid staking protocol that unlocks the liquidity of staked assets.Its offering includes:
  - For EVM LSD: rETH issued on Ethereum, rBNB issued on BSC, rMATIC issued on Polygon
  - For Polkadot LSD: rDOT,rKusama,rFIS issued on StaFi Chain 
  - For Cosmos LSD: rATOM, rHUAHUA, rSWTH, rIRIS issued on StaFi Hub
  - For Solana LSD: rSOL issued on Solana
  
Users can stake their tokens with StaFi and receive rTokens in return. To stake these tokens, StaFi batches them and routes the staking packages to chain staking contracts through validators. When users choose to unstake, the rTokens will be burned, and the user will receive their original stake tokens and rewards in return. This process ensures that users can stake and unstake their tokens seamlessly without the need for extensive technical knowledge or infrastructure.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What fee is applied by protocol">
  The protocol applies a 10% commission fee on staking rewards.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Is it safe to work with StaFi">
  To enhance the security of the StaFi, the following measures have been implemented:
  - All code is open-source, making it transparent and subject to community scrutiny.
  - Decisions related to governance and risk management are made through a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).
  - The platform has been audited by reputable firms such as Certik, PeacShield, Block Sec, and Zellic. For more detailed information, please visit [here](/audit).
  - A committee of elected, best-in-class validators has been established to minimize staking risks and ensure the integrity of the network.
